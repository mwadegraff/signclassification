# Sign Edge

### Overview:
This is a project to create a machine learning method for classification of the type of street sign that is shown in a image. The method will be to use transfer learning from a pre-trained convolutional neural network and training a classification model on the features obtained.

In general, training a good neural network to do image classification can take a lot of time and resources. Luckily there exists extremely complex networks that have been pre-trained to classify many different items. But what happens when we want to use this method on something the neural network has never seen before? It wouldn't be able to make these classifications.

This is where transfer learning comes in. Transfer learning is an extremely powerful tool in machine learning when it comes to utilizing neural networks. By passing an image through the network without retraining it, but stopping it before making its classification prediction, you can extract features that the network thought were important enough about your image. You can then train a classification model on these features with good results.

### Business Understanding:
There is always need for new methods in recognition and classification of symbols and street signs for a number of uses including: self driving cars, street mapping, and driver safety systems. Classification has been done before, but there are no references that can be found for utilizing a transfer learning from a pre trained neural network.

### The Data:
Data from a few different sources will be used. The first will be annotated LISA traffic sign dataset that can be found [here](http://cvrr.ucsd.edu/LISA/lisa-traffic-sign-dataset.html). Another source will be some pre-labeled images that was donated by the people at [Mapillary.com](http://mapillary.com). Labeled data from other sources will be utilized to improve the model further if needed.

The data will need to be cleaned by way of cropping the images down to the signs themselves, as well as weeding out any erroneous images by hand. Reducing the number of classes by grouping or by removing the classes with the least images.

### Model steps:
* Passing the LISA dataset through Inception V3 and ripping off the last node for training a classification model.
* Fitting a basic logistic regression model on small set of training data.

### Outcome:
##### Benchmarks for a minimal viable product"
* A model that makes predictions off a small data set after using transfer learning.
* Building a website to house and show off the project.

### Possible Expansion:
 A possible expansion to this project would be to use a image vision technique (e.g. OpenCV libraries) to pick the signs out of the image.
